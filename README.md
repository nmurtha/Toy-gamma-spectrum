# Toy gamma ray energy deposition spectrum
Assuming an infinite detector medium, this toy code models photoelectric and Compton scattering interactions to generate energy deposition spectra with and without perfect energy resolution. Accurate cross sections are not used, rather each interaction channel is assumed to have a 50% probability, but the general features of energy spectra are still reasonably reproduced!  

This code uses tools from the ROOT toolkit (https://root.cern)
